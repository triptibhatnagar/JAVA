        Flow of a program can be represented by flowcharts.
        FLOWCHART : 
        Visualization of our thought process or algorithm and represent them diagramatically is called flow chart.
        Symbols to be used :
        1. Start/ stop - Ovel
        2. Input/Output - Parallelogram
        3. Processing - Rectangle
        4. Condition - Diamond
        5. Flow direction of program - Arrow

        PSEUDOCODE :
        It is like a rough code which represents how the algorithm of a program works.
        It does not require syntax.
